## TL;DR
Point cloud is an important type of geometric data structure. Due to its irregular format, most researchers transform such data to regular 3D voxel grids or collections of images. This, however, renders data unnecessarily
voluminous and causes issues. In this paper, we design a novel type of neural network that directly consumes point clouds, which well respects the permutation invariance of points in the input.


## Key Ideas
- **a novel deep net architecture suitable for consuming unordered point sets in 3D:**
- **We show how such a net can be trained to perform 3D shape classification, shape part segmentation and scene semantic parsing tasks** 
- **We provide thorough empirical and theoretical analysis on the stability and efficiency of our method**
- **We illustrate the 3D features computed by the selected neurons in the net and develop intuitive explanations for its performance** 

## Notes
- Works well.
