## Biography

I am a research engineer specializing in **computer vision**, **3D perception**, and **AI systems for autonomous robotics**.  
My work focuses on building reliable perception algorithms that operate in real-world environments, particularly where safety and robustness are critical.

I received my **M.S. from Seoul National University**, where my research focused on **LiDAR-based 3D object detection in a indoor crowded environment** <a href="[https://snu.ac.kr/](https://s-space.snu.ac.kr/handle/10371/221335)">.  
I completed my **B.S. at Gachon University**, majoring in **medical image processing and AI-based medical diagnostic systems**.

My research interests lie in bridging theoretical deep learning methods with deployable AI systems, including:

- 3D Object Detection with LiDAR and Multi-modal Sensors  
- Vision-based Perception for Autonomous Robots  
- Foundation Models for Real-world AI Systems  
- Reliable AI through Data-centric Understanding and Optimization

## Research Vision

My goal is to design AI perception systems that are not only accurate in benchmarks but also **trustworthy in real operational environments** such as hospitals, where robots must safely interact with humans, equipment, and dynamic surroundings.

I am particularly interested in integrating:

- geometric understanding from 3D sensing  
- representation learning from deep neural networks  
- system-level optimization for real-time deployment
